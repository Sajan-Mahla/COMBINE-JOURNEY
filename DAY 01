so hey everyone its my DAY 1 here for COMBINE, like i learned about its define i got to know about its working.
got to know about PUBLISHER -> OPERATOR(s) -> SUBSCRIBER........

ayye WAIT here's my first CODE in COMBINE:
import Combine

let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].publisher

let pipeline = numbers
    .filter{$0 % 2 == 0}
    .map{$0 * 2}
    .sink {value in
        print("The even numbers are:", value)
    }


this is the  code which use the filter to filter out the GARBAGE value(NON-EVEN/ODD) and then multiply it by 2 then print it.....
