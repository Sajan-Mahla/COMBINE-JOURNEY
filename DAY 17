CODE:

import Combine
import Foundation

var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()

let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6].publisher

numbers
    .handleEvents(
        receiveSubscription: { _ in
            print("Subscribed")
        },
        receiveOutput: { value in
            
            print("Output Recieved: ",value)
        },
        receiveCompletion: {
            completion in
            print("Completed with:", completion)
        },
        receiveCancel: {
            print("Cancelled")
        },
        receiveRequest: {
            demand in
            print("Demand: ",demand)
        }
    )
    .map{$0 * 10}
    .print("Debug")
    .sink{
