broooooo, this combine journey is getting better day by day......
like i made a url scanner which will fetch the right url using the Error handelinng and try maps only LIKE WTF....
code:


import Combine
import Foundation

enum NetworkError: Error{
    case InvalidResponse
}

let urls = ["https://apple.com", "invalid_url", "https://developer.apple.com"]

let cancellable = urls.publisher
    .tryMap {
        urlString -> URL in
        guard let url = URL(string: urlString) else {
            throw NetworkError.InvalidResponse
        }
        return url
    }
    .map{
        $0.absoluteString.uppercased()
    }
    .catch{
        error in
        Just("Error occured: \(error)")
    }
    .sink{
        value in
        print(value)
    }
